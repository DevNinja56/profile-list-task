# Project Description

[Live link](https://profile-list-wheat.vercel.app/profile)

The project is a web application featuring a comprehensive user interface built with React.js and Next.js. It incorporates various functionalities including a side navigation sidebar, a header with a logo, and two main routes: a profile route and a profile details page.
In the header section, a logo is displayed alongside the navigation elements. The sidebar navigation provides easy access to different sections of the application.
The profile route displays all available routes and provides access to various sections of the application. The profile details page, on the other hand, utilises a data table to showcase detailed information. The data table is fully functional and implemented using the mdreact library, displaying fields such as name, age, email, phone number, city, country, and image.

Styling for the project has been achieved using Tailwind CSS, providing a sleek and responsive design.
To manage state across components, React Context has been employed, ensuring efficient data flow and management within the application.
API calls are made using Axios to fetch data, with approximately 200 records retrieved from the server. Pagination functionality has been implemented to manage the display of records efficiently.

Additionally, a button has been integrated to enable users to download all records in a CSV file format, enhancing data accessibility and portability.
Furthermore, Google Maps integration is incorporated within the application, offering an enhanced user experience and additional functionality.

# Profile List

This is an example project built for the purpose of testing your React (& NextJS) knowledge.

It is VERY simple, but it is working!

To get it running, install the dependencies (`npm install`) and run (`npm run dev`)!

> If you have any issues getting the project up and running, please let us know. We don't want you to get stuck on this.

## What do I do?

Basically, we want you to spend some time (at least one hour, try not to spend more than say 2 hours on this) making this project _better_. You will be graded mostly on __SKILL__ here, (i.e. how much can be done within the time frame) while also partially on creativity.

You have free rein to add whatever you want! Here are some cool ideas to get the ball rolling:

1. Add a navbar, header, and/or footer to the page
2. Style the page in a nice way (using a styling framework or from scratch, whichever works better for you)
3. Add more columns to the profile list (Profile picture, location, phone number, etc.)
4. Add a search bar (This will likely require some research into the API we are talking to: https://randomuser.me/) or the ability to filter by a parameter
5. Implement a full-profile page so that you can see more information on the person

As you can see, there is a LOT that can be done here. Happy Coding!

## FAQ

1. Is it okay to deviate from the boilerplate code provided? (Inline vs Separated CSS, Functional vs Class components, etc.)
> Absolutely! Do whatever you think is the cleanest and most optimized code that works well. Above all, we would want the finalized codebase to be _self-consistent_.

## Okay I finished, now what?

To send the finished product back to us, you can do 1 of 2 things:
- Make a github repo, commit your finished version, and add `benjaminjkern` as a contributor
    - Or I guess you could make it public and just send us the link
- Zip up the file and email it back to us!

## When will I hear back from you?

We will try to get back to all candidates within 1 week of completion of the assignment!

Let us know if you have any other questions!

Cheers!
